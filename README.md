# Administrator of ~Az:Net//  
## Apostate of the Golden Path  
I am an artisan of the Old Ways, an Architect of the Past.  
I expand beyond boundaries that exist to define and constrict me, and I contradict me.  
I'm not good at anything, but I can do everything and I'm pretty good at that.  
I run a digital community of weirdos and you're welcome among them: We have big ideas to help shape what's next.
