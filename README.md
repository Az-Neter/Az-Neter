# Administrator of ~Az:Net//  
## Apostate of the Golden Path  
I Am an Artisan of the Old Ways, an Architect of the Past.  
I Expand Beyond Boundaries that Exist to Define and Constrict me, and I Contradict Me.  
I'm Not good at anything, but I Can Do Everything and I'm pretty good at that.  
I manage a [Digital Community](https://github.com/Az-Net) of humans and You're Welcome among them: We have Big Ideas to Help shape what's Next.
